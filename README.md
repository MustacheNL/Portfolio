<b><h3><i>The first you need to know:</i></h3></b>

When you want to use the panel for the first time, you have to finish a little installation that requires some information about you.
When you've done that you can delete the folder "/installation/" in "/panel/", but you can also leave it there if you want to use it for reinstall. The Database has a security check for if it's already installed or not.
