# Portfolio
An easy-to-use portfolio system for everyone! Stay tuned for more.
The moment this is written, the system is unstable and at version: <b><i>V0.8 BETA 01112017</i></b>.
It's at your own risk to use this for now, because for any leaks or faults in the system I'm not responsible as developer.

<b><h3><i>The first thing you need to know:</i></h3></b>
When you want to use the panel for the first time, you have to finish a little installation that requires some information about you.
When you've done that you can delete the folder "/installation/" in "/panel/", but you can also leave it there if you want to use it for reinstall. The Database has a security check for if it's already installed or not.

<b><h3><i>Bugs? Problems? Any other issues/things?</i></h3></b>
Just open a ticket or issue request! And I will look into it.

Thanks for reading and using this wonderfull system!
